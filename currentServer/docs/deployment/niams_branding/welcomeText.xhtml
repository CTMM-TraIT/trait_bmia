The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) is a multi-center, nine-year observational study of men and women, sponsored by the National 
Institutes of Health (part of the Department of Health &amp; Human Services). The goals of the OAI are to  help us better understand 
how to prevent and treat knee osteoarthritis, one of the most common causes of disability in adults.
